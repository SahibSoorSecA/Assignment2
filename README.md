This is a landing page for a military recruitment site. Coded in html and used css styling to add animations and create a consistent theme.
Design choices. - The navbar design changes for screen sizes between 480px and 768px. - Uses a background gradient and glow effect for text. 'Sirin Stencil' font family is used for various elements. - Different font sizes and text shadow effects are applied for emphasis. Background image is set for the body with cover and no-repeat properties. - Consistent color scheme of black, white, and red tones are used for text and backgrounds. Flexbox layout is used for alignment and spacing of elements. - Cards and form elements are styled with flex and grid properties for layout. Using the hover and other css elements I was able to create an affect that when you put the cursor over the image, it displays the text for that content. Also I used an audio file that plays when you click on the home button.
